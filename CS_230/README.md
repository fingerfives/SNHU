# The Gaming Room Design Document

The client, The Gaming Room, is seeking to expand the use of the use user-base of their game by enabling multi-platform compatibility across mobile operating systems and web browsers. In order to support this endeavor, the ask from the company is to design a set of system requirements that allowed this functionality in a way that is both efficient and secure.

In creating this document, I leveraged my professional experience with developing software with both cloud and on-prem solutions in order to make the appropriate recommendations. Since I had access to the design spec of the code, I used that information to create a high-level cost-benefit analysis which ultimately led me to recommend using cloud architecture over the latter solution. Given the realtime nature of the game as described by the client, the requirements they set had a very heavy hand in the overall architectural decisions - from the decision to cache data to which cloud platform would offer the best blend of customization, cost-effectiveness, security and scalability for multiple clients. These considerations were all taken into account to ensure that the end product was able to meet the client's needs to ensure a stable and consistent experience for the end user.
