**A Reflection On Going From Client To Code**
There are millions of problems in the world on various scales in which software developers are tasked to attack. In most typical settings, it begins with a request from a client: they have a problem which needs to be solved in a very specific manner, usually in such a way that only compliments their current workflow. Though not necessarily a technical skill, being able to accurately interpret these requirements and translate them into a piece of functioning software is one which cannot be appreciated enough. Collating what the user truly needs involves, besides quite a few meetings, asking deeper questions and having the foresight to discern where failures might occur and how they should be handled. It is the understanding of these requirements which drive the final design of a system.

This journey to creating efficient, robust, and secure code is one which takes many moons and as many failures as successes to truly become good at. Fortunately, there are an incalculable number of people who have laid the foundation on what it means to achieve this. In my professional capacity as a software engineer, I look to both my seniors and peers who have had vastly different experiences than I to highlight where I may be lacking. This access to a larger wealth of knowledge is how I like to mitigate the pitfalls of assuming the capabilities I construct are the best version they can be.
