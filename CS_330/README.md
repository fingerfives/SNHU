A Reflection on Software Design
----

When taking on a new coding task, the first step which I usually take is to
flush out all the requirements to properly address the task.
 By understanding the problem, I can begin to assess whether the libraries,
 programming languages, and/or design patterns in my repertoire of skills can
 be leveraged to achieve
  the intended result. If there exist knowledge gaps, calling them out and
  seeking the appropriate
   answers often leads to a more robust final solution.
    For this final project, I was tasked with re-creating a photograph using the
    OpenGL library.
     Taking concepts learned throughout the course, this pattern of drawing out
     an initial course of action,
     highlighting and solutioning unknowns, and synthesizing the information to
     materialize a piece of
     working code worked in my favor. This is a process which I have used many
     times in a professional capacity as a software developer and, once again,
      it has proven to be an effective strategy at this challenging project.

Computational graphics was an interesting course to take as it synthesized
concepts I learned from a few previous courses, specifically from calculus,
trigonometry, and the two C++ classes. As I have already found my specialization
 in developing backend systems and cloud infrastructure, Iâ€™m not sure if the
  things I learned in this course would directly apply to my future endeavors.
  But what I gained most was a true appreciation for the work that goes into
  creating the complex graphics seen in places such as video games.
