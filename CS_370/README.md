In this project, an agent was created to explore a maze and reach the end state by utilizing both explorative 
and exploitative methods. As more games are played, the AI is meant to gradually apply the episodic data it stores
in order to traverse the map more efficiently. The part of the algorithm was built upon the provided code for building
the model, storing the agent's experience, and other supplementary methods.

Broadly speaking, computer scientists write algorithms in order to achieve a certain output. They use their knowledge of
programming languages and APIs to create dynamic programs capable of achieving the needs of an end user. When faced with
a problem, I being by analyzing the inputs, constraints, and desired outputs. Then I figure out which frameworks, languages,
and services would be best suited for the task. As logic is gradually implemented, I test the output to check for errors and
monitor that the output is becoming increasing closer to what is expected. Ethically speaking, I have a responsibility to the
end user to produce a high quality, fully functional piece of software which achieves their use case in an optimal way. To the
organization, developers have a responsibility to build application with security, efficiency, and maintainability in mind.
